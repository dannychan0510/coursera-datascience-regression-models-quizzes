# Question 1
Consider the data set given below

`x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)`

And weights given by

`w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)`

Give the value of Î¼ that minimizes the least squares equation

# Solution to Question 1

```
> x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)
> w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)
> optimize(function(u){ sum(w*(x-u)^2)}, interval=c(-100,100))
$minimum
[1] 0.1471429

$objective
[1] 3.716543
```
